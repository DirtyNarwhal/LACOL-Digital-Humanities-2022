#### Geocode your address data with Google Sheets add-on
To geocode (find latitude and longitude coordinates), we recommend installing the free [Geocoding by SmartMonkey add-on for Google Sheets](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/geocoding_by_smartmonkey/1033231575312). Insert your addresses in place of the samples in the Geocoding Details tab, then use Add-Ons > Geocoding > Geocode Details menu. Learn more in *Hands-On Data Visualization* https://handsondataviz.org/geocode.html

#### To finalize your map, you need to either:
- Download each Google Sheets tab as a CSV file and upload into a `csv` subfolder in your GitHub repo
  - OR
- Get your own Google Sheets API Key to insert into `google-doc-url.js`

## Update your code for any pre-October 2020 storymaps before January 2021
If you used our code to create a storymap prior to October 2020, you will need to update your version before January 26, 2021 for it to continue to work. Google announced that it will [migrate from Google Sheets API v3 to v4 in Jan 2021](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/v3), and we released our update of Leaflet storymaps code v1.2 on September 29th to address Google's changes.

Email us at [HandsOnDataViz@gmail.com](handsondataviz@gmail.com) if you need assistance with updating your code.
